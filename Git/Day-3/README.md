### **Installing Git**

#### **On Mac:**

1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed):**
   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Setup Homebrew Environment:**
   This command helps integrate Homebrew into your shell environment:

   ```bash
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```

3. **Install Git:**
   After Homebrew is installed, you can install Git with the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```

4. **Verify Git Installation:**
   To check if Git was successfully installed:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

#### **On Windows:**

1. Download Git from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

   This sets your global username that will be associated with your commits.

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

2. **Set Global Email:**
   This sets your email address for commit history.

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Verify the Configuration:**
   You can check the current configuration with:

### **Basic Git Commands**

1. **`git status`:**
   Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area. It shows what changes are staged, unstaged, and untracked.

2. **`git diff`:**
   Shows the differences between changes in the working directory and the last commit. Press `q` to exit the diff view.

3. **Add File to Staging Area:**
   To add all changes in the working directory to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Changes:**
   To commit changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "message"
   ```

5. **Remove File from Staging Area:**
   To remove a file from the staging area without deleting it:

   ```bash
   git reset <file>
   git restore --staged <file>
   ```

6. **View Commit Logs:**
   To view commit history:

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   To view a condensed version of the commit log:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

   To view details about a specific commit (using the commit hash):

   ```bash
   git show <hash>
   ```

7. **Revert Changes:**
   To revert to a specific commit:

   ```bash
   git reset --hard <hashCode>
   ```

   To create a new commit that undoes the changes in a previous commit:

   ```bash
   git revert <hashCode>
   ```

### **Branching in Git**

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   To create and switch to a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Delete a Branch:**
   To delete a branch:

   ```bash
   git branch -d <branch-name>  # Deletes only if merged
   git branch -D <branch-name>  # Force delete, even if unmerged
   ```

3. **Rename a Branch:**
   To rename the current branch:

   ```bash
   git branch -m <new-branch-name>
   ```

### **Git Stash:**

Git stash allows you to temporarily save your uncommitted changes and revert to the last commit.

1. **Save Changes to Stash:**

   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. **List Stashes:**

   ```bash
   git stash list
   ```

3. **Apply Stashed Changes:**

   ```bash
   git stash apply
   ```

   You can apply a specific stash:

   ```bash
   git stash apply stash@{1}
   ```

4. **Pop Stashed Changes:**

   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

5. **Clear Stashes:**

   ```bash
   git stash clear
   ```

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
   ```

2. **Rename the Default Branch to `main`:**

   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```

3. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   To push your local changes to GitHub:
